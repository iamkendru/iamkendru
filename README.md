## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Kendra Pokhrel**. I am an undergrad, for now. Currently playing along with Bachelors in Engineering: Electronics, Communication and Information Engineering, at [IOE, Purwanchal Campus](https://www.ioepc.edu.np/).
My circle calls me kendru(with love I hope). I truly am a tinkerhead, most of the time breaking stuffs. And I am a learner, mostly. I am based in Nepal.
Normally, you'll find me drowning in multiple tabs open in my laptop(my wife), either researching about a totally unreleated topic, or writing something, because that's what I do. I learn the most random things, and write even more random things.
So yes, I am a learner with great energy, studying different topics(a jack of all trades, but a master of none). I also write soemtimes, most of the time, all the time. I also am seen clicking photos, of whatever.
I am currently working on building a dual-axis motorized mount system, that I will surely further expand, integrating AI, making it a smart system. My initial goal with it is to make a low cost smart telescope mount system.

### ðŸ“š Interests

- Embedded Systems, or hardware hacking, breaking.
- Linux (I use arch btw). Terminal kiddie.
- AI/ML.
- Open Sourced.
